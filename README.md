# social_networks_in_ten_papers
Social networks, with an anthropological bias, taught with 10 classic papers.

# The Idea

We will approach the study of social network analysis from a slightly unusual perspective. Over the course of ten weeks, we will read ten classic papers in the development of the field. We will discuss the papers, their context, their key results, and extensions during class meetings. I will also augment the readings and discussions with notes and videos that cover the key technical results of the papers.

A key goal of this course is to develop familiarity with `R` tools for social network analysis.

The 10-papers format was the brain child of co-conspirator [Elspeth Ready](https://elspethr.github.io/). In the Fall of 2020, I did [life history theory in ten papers](https://eehh-stanford.github.io/life_history_in_ten_papers/).

# Supplementary Notes and Videos

Eventually, there may be some supplementary notes and videos to go here that don't necessarily fit with any of the specific weeks.
